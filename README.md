###  Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of Diabetic Patient Records

Databases of [clinical data](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/) contain valuable but heterogeneous and difficult data in terms of missing values, 
incomplete or inconsistent records, and high dimensionality understood not only by number of features but also 
their complexity. Nonetheless, it is important to utilize these huge amounts of data to find new 
information/knowledge that is possibly not available anywhere.

### Results
Model is able to predict readmission rates with 63% test accuracy among age 0-30. Prediction becomes less accurate when model runs across all ages.

Most misclassifications in emergency cases (<30 days). There are probably various factors contributing to emergency readmission.
